The goals of this project were:

Get familiar with the types of behaviors that can be displayed by malware and how to safely analyze these behaviors.

We ran malware through a secure environment to see what actions the malware will perform, using a tool called [Cuckoo] (http://www.cuckoosandbox.org)

We had an outer VM where we did all of the work, and an inner VM that was be used by Cuckoo to do the analysis. 
The outer VM is Ubuntu Linux, and the inner VM is Windows XP.
