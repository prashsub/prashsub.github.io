Implemented k-means clustering to segment a color image.
Built a Gaussian mixture model to be trained with expectation-maximization.
Implemented and test a new metric called the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which guarantees a more robust image segmentation and penalizes models based on the number of parameters they us.
