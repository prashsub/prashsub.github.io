Dr. Stephen Penman has a book that I read last year, called Accounting for Valuation.

This book talks about how to value a company using their balance sheets, and income statements.

This method of valuation, is different from a discounted cash flow method. In Discounted Cash Flow method, a companies cash flows from future are taken into account and discounted appropriately for risk and cost of equity to come to a certain valuation.

In Accounting for Value, we go about in a different way. Future growth is speculative and hence is separated from the valuation model.

Current value is determined by stripping away any leverage due to financial activities, and importance is given to operational income.

I used to do this method of valuation manually in excel, but it took a long time to parse through 10-K documents.

This notebook is a step in the direction of making the valuation process automatized, based on the principles outlined in Dr. Penman's book.

The code base for this can be found at the following repository.
