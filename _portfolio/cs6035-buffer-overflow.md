# Buffer Overflow

The goals of this project were as follows: 
- Understanding how stack and heap memory are used
- Understanding the concepts of buffer overflow
- Exploiting a stack buffer overflow vulnerability
- Understanding code reuse attacks (advanced buffer overflow attacks) 
- Launch an attack that exploits a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in a provided sort.c program. 

The assignment explored the details of stack and heap memory architecture, and how exactly a buffer overflow vulnerability is exploited.

Assignment Report and Code available on request.
